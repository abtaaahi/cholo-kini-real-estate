### Why Legal Support is Crucial  

Investing in property involves more than just financial considerations—it requires meticulous legal checks to avoid future disputes, fraud, or compliance issues. Legal vetting ensures:  
- *Ownership Verification:* Confirm that the seller has the legal right to sell the property.  
- *Clear Title:* Ensure the property is free from encumbrances, disputes, or legal claims.  
- *Regulatory Compliance:* Verify that the property adheres to local zoning and development regulations.  
- *Fraud Prevention:* Avoid fraudulent transactions that can lead to financial and legal complications.
